# 5tratumFW for NerdQAxe++ — BETA

This source builds the QAxe-specific paired OTA images for **NerdQAxe++ / NERDQAXEPLUS2 with four BM1370 ASICs**. It is a GPLv3 derivative of [shufps ESP-Miner-NerdQAxePlus](https://github.com/shufps/ESP-Miner-NerdQAxePlus). Upstream authors and licenses are retained; the original documentation is in [upstream-readme](docs/upstream-readme.md).

Firmware version: `5tratumFW-qa-0.1.0-beta.2`. This QAxe image is separate from the Gamma 601/602 image. Beta 2 corrects legacy update-page model detection and OTP lookup. The existing test unit ran Beta 1; its physical PCB revision remains unidentified. Beta 2 has build/browser qualification and no new physical OTA qualification.

## Choose the correct firmware

| Device | Image family | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bitaxe Gamma PCB 601/602 | Gamma images in the parent 5tratumFW repository; never these QAxe images | Gamma 601 paired Beta4 installed; Gamma602 compiled, unflashed |
| NerdQAxe++ / NERDQAXEPLUS2 / BM1370 ×4 | This QAxe paired BETA | Prior a10 installed-device record; unknown PCB revision. Check this BETA's own validation before installing |
| QAxe+, other QAxe/OctAxe revisions, NerdOctAxe, NerdQX, GT800 and other devices | No supported image in this QAxe release | Do not infer compatibility from shared upstream driver definitions |

## Included

- Gamma-style six-page navigation: Overview, Miner controls, Scheduler, Pool routing, Network and Updates. More keeps Security, Alerts, InfluxDB, System, Network miners and capability-gated CAN fleet.
- Both fan controllers, thermal shutdown limits, SV1/SV2 connection settings, optional verification, named tuning slots and ten named pool slots.
- Explicit 1MHz/1mV manual requests and nearby operating-point Review/Apply. Existing saved operating points are retained; these are requests subject to hardware quantization, not automatic tuning.
- Weekly power pause windows and independent pool-switch time points, saved and executed on the miner. Pool schedules currently select connection A/primary only; manual profile Apply can target A or B.
- Separate native A/B network sessions through 5tratMUX, with independent MUX routing/accounting and one physical-parent card.
- Per-session fresh MUX coin identity, candidate height, nBits, bdiff and current forwarded job. Mixed dual mining has separate coin/job information; no single aggregate chain is invented.
- Physical screen branding, scrolling startup progress and recurring large 5tratumFW logo, plus route/job and shared board/regulator readings. Thermal, shutdown and enrollment overlays take priority.

The two sessions share the ASIC chain's existing job selector. This release does **not** prove or implement independent physical-ASIC work ownership; `independentWorkAssignment` remains false. Advertised controller/session identity is a peer report rather than authentication.

## Install, operate and build

Use both `esp-miner-NerdQAxe++.bin` and `www.bin` from the same QAxe package. Confirm the manifest model and hashes. OTA retains existing NVS settings; never erase flash or write a factory image as a routine upgrade.
